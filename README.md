# JavaScript Fundamentals Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts including variable declarations, conditionals, functions, loops, and DOM interactions. It also contains a structured HTML5 page and optional CSS styling.

---

## Project Structure

- `index.html`  
  Contains the semantic HTML5 structure of the webpage, divided into four main sections corresponding to each part of the assignment.

- `style.css` *(optional)*  
  Provides basic styling for better readability and user experience.

- `script.js`  
  The JavaScript file implementing the following parts:
  - **Part 1:** Variable declarations and conditionals  
  - **Part 2:** Two custom functions with event-driven interaction  
  - **Part 3:** Two examples of loops (for loop and while loop)  
  - **Part 4:** At least three DOM interactions including event listeners and dynamic content updates

## Detailed Description

### Part 1: Variables and Conditionals

- Demonstrates declaring variables with `let` and `const`.
- Uses conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to display messages based on variable values.
- Outputs result to the DOM.

### Part 2: Custom Functions

- Includes two functions:  
  - `greetUser(name)` returns a greeting string.  
  - `calculateSum(a, b)` returns the sum of two numbers.
- Functions are triggered by button clicks and display results dynamically.

### Part 3: Loops

- For loop: Generates a list of numbers from 1 to 5.
- While loop: Generates a list of even numbers less than 10.
- Results appended to the DOM dynamically as list items.

### Part 4: DOM Interactions

- Includes three distinct interactions:  
  1. Input field to accept user text.  
  2. Button to display the entered text dynamically.  
  3. Validation to check for empty input and show an appropriate message.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
3. Interact with the buttons and input fields to see JavaScript functionality in action.

## Notes

- The CSS file is optional and can be omitted without affecting the core JavaScript functionality.
- The code is fully commented for clarity and learning purposes.
